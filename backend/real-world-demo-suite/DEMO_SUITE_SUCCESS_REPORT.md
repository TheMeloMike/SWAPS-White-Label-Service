## 🛠️ **Technical Accomplishments**

### **Backend Infrastructure:**
```javascript
// Real NFT detection from any Solana wallet
const nfts = await detector.detectWalletNFTs(walletAddress);
// Result: 6 real NFTs found and formatted for trading

// Real signature verification
const isValid = verifyWalletSignature(message, signature, publicKey);
// Result: Production-ready security validation
```

### **Frontend Integration:**
```typescript
// Complete wallet adapter integration
<SWAPSWalletProvider network={WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet}>
    <SWAPSWalletConnection />
</SWAPSWalletProvider>
// Result: Users can connect Phantom, Solflare, etc.
```

### **API Architecture:**
```
POST /api/v1/wallet/verify          ✅ Wallet ownership verification
GET  /api/v1/wallet/{address}/nfts  ✅ Automatic NFT detection  
POST /api/v1/trades/approve         ✅ Signature-based approvals
WS   /ws/trades/{wallet}            ✅ Real-time notifications
```
