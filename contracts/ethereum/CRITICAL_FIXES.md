# CRITICAL FIXES FOR ETHEREUM SMART CONTRACT

## üî• IMMEDIATE PRIORITY FIXES

Based on the security audit, these fixes must be implemented before production deployment:

### 1. **CRITICAL: Enhanced Trade Balance Validation**

**Issue**: Current validation only checks participants give/receive NFTs, doesn't verify actual balance.

**Fix Required**: Replace the placeholder validation with comprehensive balance checking.

### 2. **MEDIUM: Complete Platform Fee Implementation**

**Issue**: Platform fee collection is a placeholder that only emits events.

**Fix Required**: Implement actual fee collection mechanism.

### 3. **LOW: Add Missing Administrative Events**

**Issue**: Some admin actions don't emit events for monitoring.

**Fix Required**: Add events for all administrative functions.
