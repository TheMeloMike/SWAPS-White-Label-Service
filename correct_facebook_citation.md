```

**Also add:**
```
"Analysis of 721 million Facebook users found an average path length of 4.74, corresponding to 3.74 degrees of separation (Backstrom et al., 2012)²"
```

## Why This Citation is Better:

1. **Peer-reviewed** academic publication
2. **Massive scale** (721M users, 69B links)
3. **Rigorous methodology** with statistical error bounds
4. **Published in legitimate venue** (ACM Web Science Conference)
5. **Available as both conference paper and arXiv preprint**

The 2016 blog post, while from Facebook Research, is not peer-reviewed and is more of a company announcement than scientific research.
