## Usage Guidelines

### Running Individual Tests
```bash
cd test-scripts/[category]/
node [test-script-name].js
```

### Running Category Tests
```bash
# Run all algorithm tests
for script in test-scripts/algorithm-tests/*.js; do node "$script"; done

# Run all performance tests
for script in test-scripts/performance-tests/*.js; do node "$script"; done
```

### Test Dependencies
Most tests require:
- `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable set
- Live API endpoint (https://swaps-93hu.onrender.com)
- Node.js with required packages

### Test Categories by Purpose

**Development & Debugging:**
- `algorithm-tests/` - Core functionality verification
- `optimization-tests/` - Performance improvements

**Quality Assurance:**
- `audit-tests/` - System validation
- `performance-tests/` - Load and performance testing
- `ux-tests/` - Client experience validation

**Infrastructure:**
- `kafka-tests/` - Distributed processing
- `uploader-tests/` - Data management

## Historical Context

These test scripts were developed during the SWAPS optimization and enterprise readiness phase (July-August 2025) to validate:

1. **Algorithm Sophistication**: Moving from 33% to 100% algorithm utilization
2. **Performance Optimization**: Achieving <5ms security overhead
3. **Enterprise Readiness**: 100% security score and audit compliance
4. **Multi-party Trading**: Complex trade loop discovery and execution
5. **Production Stability**: Real-world load testing and validation

## Maintenance Notes

- Scripts are organized by functionality for easier maintenance
- Each category focuses on specific aspects of the system
- Test scripts include both unit-level and integration-level testing
- Many scripts can be run independently for targeted testing
- Some scripts require specific system states or data conditions

**Total Scripts Organized**: 58 files across 7 categories
